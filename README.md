<h1>Suriya Music App - GitHub Repository</h1>



<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>Suriya is a music application developed for Android devices, designed to play music files stored locally on the user's device. The unique feature of this app is its support for multiple languages, including Assamese, English, French, Hindi, and Tamil, making it one of the few music players to cater to a diverse user base. The app is lightweight, consuming less than 10 MB of storage, and is designed to run smoothly without affecting the performance of other applications on the device. This project was developed in the year 2022 while I was studying at GUIST (Gauhati University Institute of Science and Technology) with my project partner, Rahul Dev Mahato.</p>
